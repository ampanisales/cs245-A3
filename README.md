A3.java has the main function and is the program that is supposed to be run. The program uses JSON-simple to read the 'tmdb_5000_credits.csv' file. While reading the file, the program will print the number of movies that have been checked so far. After the program is finished reading the file, the total number of actors read from the file will be printed, then the user can enter the names of two actors that the user wants to find a path between.
